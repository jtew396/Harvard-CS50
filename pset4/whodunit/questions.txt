1.  stdint.h is a programming library in C for BMP related data types
2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t are fixed integer data types for creating images
3.  BYTE is 8 bytes, DWORD is 32 bytes, LONG is 32 bytes, WORD is 16 bytes.
4.  The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" (066) then the character "M" (077) in ASCII encoding.
5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. biSize is the size, in bytes, of the image.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB file with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If the file locations do not exist or cannot be created.
9.  1 is the number of elements being read at a time. We only need to read 1 element.
10. 4
11. fseek sets the file position of the stream to the given offset.
12. SEEK_CUR moves a file pointer position to a given location.
